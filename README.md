# jrh-atp

Code resources for John Harrison's "Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning".
The material here started with exactly the tar file referenced on Harrison's resource page
https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/atp/index.html.  It has been updated to work with much
more recent versions of OCaml and OCaml tools, and some of the convenience functionality
has been extended.

To set up OCaml for use with this repository, get a version of OCaml 4.x.  This has
been tested with version 4.10.0, installed with OPAM using

```sh <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)```

as described at https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html.
